# By default, Distutils (the packaging framework, called in setup.py) will include the following files in your release package:
#    README.txt
#    setup.py
#    The .py files needed by the multi-file modules listed in the packages parameter
#    The individual .py files listed in the py_modules parameter 

# See explanation in: http://www.diveintopython3.net/packaging.html

# Use .add_data_files and .add_data_dir methods in a appropriate
# setup.py files to include non-python files such as documentation,
# data, etc files to distribution. Avoid using MANIFEST.in for that

include MANIFEST.in
include LICENSE
#include INSTALL
include README.rst
